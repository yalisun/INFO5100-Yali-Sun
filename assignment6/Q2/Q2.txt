Q: Write two differences between ArrayList and LinkedList.

1. ArrayList is implemented using dynamic array, which may need resizing with O(n).
While LinkedList is implemented using doubly linked node, which does not need resizing.

2. Access in ArrayList costs O(1), but insertion and removal cost O(n) as it needs to rearrange all elements.
While LinkedList access needs to iterate over costing O(n), but insertion and removal only cost O(1) when the element is found.
